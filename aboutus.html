		Analytical and detail-oriented office administrator with over 10 years experience coordinating,

		get my BAS in Information Technology with the Web Coding and Developing concentration. I did a web development internship at Code Explorers
		during the Fall 18' semester and I have been a full time student since Spring 19'. While being in school full time, I became the President 
		of the inTech Club at Broward College. I have brought speakers who are professionals in the field from comapnies like: Magic Leap, Creative Drive
